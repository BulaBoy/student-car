Hey there! 👋 My name is Bulat, just a regular guy who loves coding in React! ❤️

This project is a super idea for a taxi ordering app, but with an awesome twist! ✨ FOR STUDENTS! 🎓

What do college and university students love? They love simplicity and Telegram! 💬 Right there in Telegram Mini Apps, users will be able to easily create ride requests, pick up classmates, and more! 🚗💨

I'm incredibly excited to build this myself... And you can watch it all unfold! 😉 Let's see where this adventure takes us! 🚀
